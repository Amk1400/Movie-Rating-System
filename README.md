# Movie-Rating-System
This project involves designing a movie recommendation system based on user interaction data, including information about movies, actors, and genres, as well as user management and maintenance. The data will be stored in a PostgreSQL database, and the required operations will be carried out through APIs implemented using FastAPI.
